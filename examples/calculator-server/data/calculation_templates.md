## Financial Analysis Templates

### 1. Investment Analysis Template

#### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Analysis
```
Project: [Project Name]
Analysis Date: [Date]
Analyst: [Name]

Assumptions:
- Analysis Period: [Years]
- Discount Rate: [%]
- Terminal Growth Rate: [%]
- Tax Rate: [%]

Year 0 (Initial Investment): $[Amount]

Projected Cash Flows:
Year 1: $[Amount]
Year 2: $[Amount]
Year 3: $[Amount]
Year 4: $[Amount]
Year 5: $[Amount]

Terminal Value Calculation:
CF Year 6 = Year 5 CF × (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)

NPV Calculation:
PV of Cash Flows = Σ(CF_t / (1 + discount_rate)^t)
NPV = PV of Cash Flows - Initial Investment

Decision Criteria:

## Calculation Best Practices

### Accuracy Guidelines

1. **Rounding Rules**:
   - Financial amounts: Round to nearest cent ($0.01)
   - Percentages: Round to 2 decimal places (0.01%)
   - Ratios: Round to 2-4 decimal places depending on context
   - Large amounts: Consider rounding to nearest thousand or million for readability

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Always validate input parameters are reasonable
   - Check for division by zero errors
   - Verify that rates are expressed consistently (decimal vs. percentage)
   - Ensure time periods are correctly aligned

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Document all assumptions clearly
   - Cite sources for benchmark data
   - Include calculation date and analyst information
   - Provide sensitivity analysis for key variables

4. **Quality Control**:
   - Perform reasonableness checks on results
   - Compare results to industry benchmarks
   - Review calculations with a second party
   - Test edge cases and unusual scenarios
