# Incident Response Workflows

## Overview

This document outlines the standard incident response workflows and notification procedures for our development team. These workflows are integrated into our notification server to automate communication and escalation during incidents.

## Incident Severity Levels

### P0 - Critical (Service Down)
**Response Time**: Immediate  
**Escalation**: Automatic after 5 minutes  
**Channels**: All channels (Slack, Email, SMS, PagerDuty)

**Criteria:**
- Complete service outage affecting all users
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach with confirmed data exposure
- Payment processing completely down

**Response Process:**
1. **Immediate Response** (0-5 minutes)
   - Incident Commander auto-assigned to on-call engineer
   - War room created automatically
   - All critical stakeholders notified via all channels
   - Status page updated to "Major Outage"

2. **Escalation** (5-15 minutes if unresolved)
   - Engineering Manager and SRE Lead notified
   - Additional SMEs brought in based on service area
   - Customer support team alerted
   - Leadership notification sent

### P1 - High (Degraded Service)
**Response Time**: Within 15 minutes  
**Escalation**: After 30 minutes  
**Channels**: Slack, Email, SMS for on-call

**Criteria:**
- Significant performance degradation (>50% of normal)
- Feature completely unavailable but service accessible
- Database connectivity issues
- API error rate >5%

**Response Process:**
1. **Initial Response** (0-15 minutes)
   - On-call engineer assigned
   - Engineering team notified via Slack
   - Investigation begins
   - Status page updated to "Degraded Performance"

2. **Escalation** (30 minutes if unresolved)
   - Team Lead and additional engineers notified
   - War room created if needed
   - Customer impact assessment

### P2 - Medium (Minor Issues)
**Response Time**: Within 1 hour  
**Escalation**: After 4 hours  
**Channels**: Slack, Email

**Criteria:**
- Minor feature degradation
- Non-critical service issues
- Monitoring alerts that don't impact users
- Performance degradation <25%

**Response Process:**
1. **Initial Response** (0-1 hour)
   - Engineering team notified via Slack
   - Issue triaged during business hours
   - Investigation and fix planned

2. **Escalation** (4 hours if unresolved)
   - Team Lead notified
   - Priority reassessment

### P3 - Low (Informational)
**Response Time**: Next business day  
**Escalation**: Manual only  
**Channels**: Slack

**Criteria:**
- Minor bugs with workarounds
- Informational alerts
- Non-urgent maintenance needs

## Incident Workflow States

### 1. Detection
**Automated Triggers:**
- Monitoring system alerts (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application error rate thresholds
- Health check failures
- User-reported issues via support channels

**Notification Actions:**
- Create incident record with unique ID
- Determine initial severity based on alert type
- Notify on-call engineer via appropriate channels
- Start incident timeline tracking

### 2. Response
**Immediate Actions:**
- Incident Commander assignment (usually on-call engineer)
- Create war room (Slack channel or Zoom meeting)
- Initial impact assessment
- Begin investigation and mitigation

**Notification Actions:**
- Regular status updates every 15-30 minutes
- Escalation notifications if SLA breached
- Stakeholder updates based on impact scope
- Customer communication if external impact

### 3. Resolution
**Resolution Actions:**
- Implement fix or workaround
- Verify service restoration
- Update status page
- Communicate resolution to all stakeholders

**Notification Actions:**
- Send resolution notification to all affected parties
- Include resolution time and brief summary
- Link to post-mortem (for P0/P1 incidents)
- Thank response team

### 4. Post-Incident
**Follow-up Actions:**
- Schedule post-mortem for P0/P1 incidents
- Document lessons learned
- Update monitoring and alerting if needed
- Implement preventive measures

**Notification Actions:**
- Post-mortem meeting invitation
- Action item assignments and tracking
- Follow-up on preventive measures

## Notification Escalation Matrix

| Time | P0 Critical | P1 High | P2 Medium | P3 Low |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 0 min | On-call + War Room | On-call | Engineering Team | Engineering Team |
| 5 min | + Manager + SRE Lead | | | |
| 15 min | + Additional SMEs | + Team Lead | | |
| 30 min | + Leadership | + Manager | | |
| 1 hour | + Customer Success | + Additional Engineers | Team Lead | |
| 4 hours | + Executive Team | + Manager | Manager | |

- **PagerDuty**: Critical incident escalation and on-call management
- **Slack**: Primary team communication and war room coordination
- **Jira**: Incident tracking and post-mortem action items
- **Datadog/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting integration
- **GitHub**: Deployment and code change correlation
- **Status Page**: Customer communication and transparency

### Automation Rules
- Auto-create war rooms for P0/P1 incidents
- Correlate deployments with incident timing
- Auto-assign Incident Commander based on on-call rotation
- Escalate based on time and severity rules
- Update status page based on incident status
- Generate post-mortem templates automatically

## On-Call Procedures

### Handoff Protocol
1. **Weekly Handoff** (Mondays 9 AM PT)
   - Previous on-call summarizes week's incidents
   - Current issues and monitoring watchpoints
   - Any scheduled maintenance or deployments
   - Contact information verification

2. **Emergency Handoff**
   - Immediate context transfer
   - Active incident status
   - War room transfer
   - Stakeholder notification

### Response Expectations
- **Acknowledge** incident within 5 minutes
- **Initial assessment** within 15 minutes
- **Regular updates** every 30 minutes
- **Escalate** if unable to resolve within SLA

### Tools and Access
- Phone and laptop available 24/7
- VPN access for remote troubleshooting
- Emergency access to production systems
- Contact list for escalations
- Documentation and runbook access

This incident response framework ensures consistent, timely communication during service disruptions while maintaining appropriate escalation paths based on severity and business impact.
