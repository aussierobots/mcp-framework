# ULTRATHINK: Working Memory & TODO Consolidation System

## Problem Analysis

**Current State:**
- Multiple TODO files: `TODO_framework.md`, `TODO_examples.md`, `TODO_streamable_http.md`
- TodoWrite tool shows immediate tasks but doesn't persist across conversations
- Knowledge gets fragmented and can become stale
- Context window expiration requires re-researching the same issues
- No single source of truth for current project understanding

**Core Issues:**
1. **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Insights scattered across multiple files
2. **Context Loss**: When conversations restart, we lose accumulated understanding
3. **Research Duplication**: Re-analyzing the same code/decisions repeatedly
4. **Priority Confusion**: Hard to know what's most important right now
5. **Staleness**: Old information that may no longer be accurate
6. **Bootstrap Inefficiency**: Takes too long to restore context in new conversations

## Proposed Solution: Hierarchical Working Memory System

### Architecture

```
WORKING_MEMORY.md (Master Entry Point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current Understanding & Priority Stack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Active Context (what we're doing right now)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick Bootstrap (for new conversations) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Links to specialized TODO files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Learning Journal (chronological discoveries)

TODO_framework.md (Technical Deep Dive)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Detailed framework analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation gaps and solutions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-level technical details

TODO_streamable_http.md (Specialized Domain)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HTTP transport compliance analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Session management design
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation roadmap

TODO_examples.md (Another Specialized Domain)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Example creation strategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Compilation issues and fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Learning path organization
```

### Master Working Memory Structure

```markdown
# MCP Framework - Working Memory
*Last Updated: [DATE] by [CONVERSATION_ID]*

## üéØ Current Priority Stack
1. **[HIGHEST]** What we're actively working on
2. **[HIGH]** Next immediate task  
3. **[MEDIUM]** Follow-up work
4. **[LOW]** Future considerations

## üß† Current Understanding (Key Insights)
- **Framework Status**: One-line summary of where framework stands
- **Major Decisions Made**: Key architectural or approach decisions
- **Working Hypothesis**: Current theory of what needs to be done
- **Blockers**: What's preventing progress

## üìç Active Context
- **Just Completed**: What we finished in the last session
- **Currently Working On**: What task is in progress
- **Immediate Next Step**: The very next thing to do
- **Open Questions**: What we need to figure out

## üöÄ Quick Bootstrap (For New Conversations)
*[3-4 sentences that let anyone quickly understand current state]*

## üìö Specialized Knowledge Areas
- [`TODO_framework.md`](TODO_framework.md) - Framework implementation details
- [`TODO_streamable_http.md`](TODO_streamable_http.md) - HTTP transport compliance
- [`TODO_examples.md`](TODO_examples.md) - Example creation and fixes

## üìñ Learning Journal (Chronological)
### [DATE] - Major Discovery/Decision
- What we learned
- How it changed our approach
- New priorities that emerged

### [DATE] - Previous Entry
- Historical context
- Evolution of understanding
```

### Update Discipline & Triggers

**Update WORKING_MEMORY.md when:**
1. **New major insight** discovered about the codebase
2. **Priority changes** due to new information
3. **Major task completion** that changes the landscape
4. **Decision made** that affects future work
5. **Hypothesis proven/disproven** 
6. **At end of significant work session**

**Update Specialized TODO files when:**
1. **Deep technical analysis** completed
2. **Implementation details** worked out
3. **Code-level discoveries** made
4. **Detailed roadmaps** created

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Current State
1. **Create master WORKING_MEMORY.md** with current understanding
2. **Consolidate key insights** from existing TODO files
3. **Establish current priority stack** based on recent work
4. **Document active context** of what we're doing now

### Phase 2: Establish Update Rhythm  
1. **End-of-session updates** to capture what we learned
2. **Start-of-session reviews** to restore context quickly
3. **Priority stack adjustments** as new info emerges
4. **Cross-reference maintenance** between master and specialized files

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. **Template refinement** based on usage patterns
2. **Automation opportunities** for common updates
3. **Link maintenance** between files
4. **Archive strategy** for old/completed items

## Benefits of This System

### For Context Preservation
- **Single entry point** to understand current state
- **Chronological learning** preserved in journal
- **Quick bootstrap** section for rapid context restoration
- **Priority clarity** prevents confusion about what matters

### For Knowledge Management
- **Prevents re-research** through consolidated insights
- **Maintains historical context** of decisions and discoveries
- **Balances overview with detail** via hierarchical structure
- **Encourages continuous learning capture**

### For Productivity
- **Reduces session startup time** via quick bootstrap
- **Maintains momentum** across context boundaries
- **Prevents priority drift** through explicit stack management
- **Enables better handoffs** between conversation sessions

## Success Metrics

**How we'll know it's working:**
1. **Faster session starts**: New conversations can become productive within 2-3 exchanges
2. **Less re-research**: Rarely need to re-analyze the same code/issues
3. **Clear priorities**: Always obvious what the most important next task is
4. **Preserved insights**: Key discoveries don't get lost when context expires
5. **Coherent progress**: Work builds on previous sessions rather than restarting

## Implementation Rules

### Golden Rules
1. **Update working memory BEFORE ending significant work sessions**
2. **Start new conversations by reading WORKING_MEMORY.md first** 
3. **One source of truth for current priorities** (the priority stack)
4. **Learning journal gets updated when major insights occur**
5. **Bootstrap section must be maintained to allow rapid context restoration**

### Maintenance Discipline
- **Review working memory at start of each session**
- **Update priority stack as new information emerges**
- **Cross-reference specialized TODO files for technical details**
- **Archive completed items to prevent file bloat**
- **Timestamp all significant updates**

This system transforms scattered TODO files into a coherent working memory that preserves context, accelerates session startup, and prevents knowledge loss across conversation boundaries.
